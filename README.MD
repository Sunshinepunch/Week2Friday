It uses branching functions and assigns a point amount to each answer. At the end of the quiz, the user submits their total via button and the page returns an answer based on the point total. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* A browser is all that is required. Simply run the index.html file and answer the questions! Note* There is no accessibility added for sight impaired users, but functionality will be updated once I learn how!
