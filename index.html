              Programming is a great choice for a career! There are so many
              different things you can choose to do with programming. Whether
              you want to design web pages, build the computational side of
              business software, or even work with researchers on cataloguing
              and sorting data, programming is the premier option for those of
              us who have to work for a living! But how to start? Well,
              programming begins with the language you choose to learn, and this
              handy quiz below will help analyze your personality and recommend
              a good language fit!

            recommended to beginners! It is widely used in the field and will
            provide a strong jumping off point for those interested in
            developing software and data analysis and visualization. It can
            often be used to automate tasks, making it a handy tool for even
            non-programmers to learn!

            This language is used in both front-end and back-end web
            development, as well as for mobile apps and game creation. If you
            want to focus on interactions with the World Wide Web, Javascript
            will get you where you want to be! It is also a very useful tool for

            for using C# on a very large scale, and for those interested in game
            development, C# is used in the widely available Unity game engine.
